# IT DevCon 2024

The [IT DevCon 2024](https://www.itdevcon.it/roma/en/speakers/) European Delphi Conference will be held on 20241114 and 20241115 in Rome, Italy.

Like always, the link to the conference start page will point to different content each time the conference is organised, so make sure that if you want to access 2024 materials at a later point in time, then start at the Wayback Machine archived links starting at [Wayback to ITDevCon2024](https://web.archive.org/web/20241108175924/https://www.itdevcon.it/roma/en/).
